### Interesting technologies, that I use in my projects

- [Relm4](https://github.com/Relm4/Relm4) - Roughly speaking, it's GTK for Rust.
- [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) - Cross-platform framework on .NET for apps development

Also I have a one small project on Remora.Discord, and it's my bot, [OMORI-BOT](https://github.com/M23SNEZ3/OMORI-BOT)
